This repository contains shared tools developed by the STONE-IGWave team as part of the USCRP SEDCOLAB project, including laboratory scaling tools, laboratory observational data processing and analysis scripts, and model development and analysis tools. 

The subfolder coawst-tools will hold routines to develop a COAWST Modeling System application for the CHL 10-ft flume, and to analyze COAWST model results.
